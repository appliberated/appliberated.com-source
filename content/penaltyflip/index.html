            With PenaltyFlip it's easy to choose between multiple penalty card colors. Show a red card for ejection and personal embarrassment, or a yellow card
            as a warning and a second chance. Show a blue card to make him/her stay in a penalty box, a green card to indicate an official warning for a minor
            offence, a white card to give a timeout penalty, or a black card for severe rule infractions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Time to show the penalty card, but can't decide which one? Just tap the Shuffle icon to "flip the coin" and let PenaltyFlip decide the color of the
            penalty card.

        <p>
            There is also a menu option for turning the full brightness of the screen when showing the penalty card.
